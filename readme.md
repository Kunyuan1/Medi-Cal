## Medi-Cal
Medi-cal is a web application that simplfiies the organization of surgeon-patient scheduling.
## Features
Medi-cal will be used by logged-in surgeons to schedule surgeon-patient meetings. Users will have the ability to book appointments with proper time validation methods in place. Then, appointments can be viewed in a calendar, edited/deleted, and follow up surgeries are booked. Specific appointments on a past/future date, or by ID, may also be found. 
## Installation
1. Download the latest version of Python.

2. Clone the github repo from 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Combareus/Medi-Cal.git. 
   ```
2. Download django package
   ```sh
   pip install django
   ```
3. Run the local server with
   ```sh
   pip install django
   ```


## Known Bugs
Users may bypass the login system by manually inputting the url, however, they will have significantly less functionality as input and output surgeries are without the corresponding account.
